Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a micro Service.
It is developed by Pivotal Team and is used to build stand-alone and production ready spring applications.

While the Spring framework focuses on providing flexibility to you, Spring Boot aims to shorten the code length and provide you with the easiest way to develop a web application. 
With annotation configuration and default codes, Spring Boot shortens the time involved in developing an application.


What is spring boot?
* Spring boot is a module of spring which makes easy to create stand-alone, product-grade spring based application that you can 'just-run'
* spring framework + embedded servers - manual configuration = spring boot
* features of Spring Boot:
  1) conventional over configuration software design style
      -> Decrease the effort of developer
  2) Opiniated default 
      -> automatic configuration
      -> scan the class path and find the dependency it will automatically configure the things
  3) it creates stand-alone spring application that can be started using java -jar
  4) embed tomcat no need to deploy WAR files
  5) no xml configuration and code generation
  many more..

what is spring?
* it is a application framework that provides template, framework for creating Enterprise applications

In pom.xml file org.springframework.boot is a parent package for a current project
	-> parent packages are defined in <parent></parent>
all the dependencies are defined inside 
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>...</dependency>
	</dependencies> 

build spring boot application:
1) goto start.spring.io 
2) add artifact, java version and necessary dependencies -- web dependency for creating restful services
3) download the package in zip file and extract in workspace
4) after opening file in sts we can directly run the application as it contains default configurations

@SpringBootApplication
public class CourseApiAppApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(CourseApiAppApplication.class, args);
	}

}

@SpringBootApplication is annotation to represent the class as it is spring boot application which is start point of the application
SpringApplication.run(className,args) -- run is static method
