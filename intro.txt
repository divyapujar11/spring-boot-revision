Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a micro Service.
It is developed by Pivotal Team and is used to build stand-alone and production ready spring applications.

While the Spring framework focuses on providing flexibility to you, Spring Boot aims to shorten the code length and provide you with the easiest way to develop a web application. 
With annotation configuration and default codes, Spring Boot shortens the time involved in developing an application.
